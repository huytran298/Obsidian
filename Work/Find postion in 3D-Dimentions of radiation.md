## Generals
Set up an three detector as three vertices of an equilateral triangle in an rectangle plane. The center of triangle will be the origin position that we see as a landmark of radiation source (we see the position as $(0; 0; 0)$ in *3D spartial coordinates*) with survey the position by result of detector and 3D position of 3D CNC. After thatm, we will set up complete the algorithm for detect position of radiation sources for the model.
## Algorithm
### What we have ?
So we will use the MPPC
