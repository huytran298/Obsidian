## Defination
The **photoelectric effect** is emission of electron from marterial when exposed to a short wave lenght (such as **UV light**). Electron gain high energy from photon as large than work function, that electron emission called photoelectron.
- Based on the photoelectric effect: **External** or **Internal** 
- Need “photosensitive” materials $(K, Na, Rb)$, which have high tendency to release electrons (or small electronegativity)
- Typically need to turn this microscopic “electron-emission” signal into the macroscopic level, eg. multiplication
### Internal photoelectric effect
photoelectron is moved from valence band into the conduction band
### External photoelectric effect
photoelectron is ejected into free space.
