## Fast and low-light detection
### Why fast and low-light detection

- Light is a omnipotent tools to perceive almost everything from the world of sub-atomic particles to the Cosmos • Light is also a sustainable and effective solution for various sectors of modern life (food, communication, entertainment, energy, environment, medicine…) 
- Modern life demands high-speed on almost everything ➜ Nothing (physical object) is faster than light (in vaccum). To harness power of light-speed, one may need help. From fast-response (ns-level) photosensor.
- When come to *ns-level*, you may not have an intense light (photons) reaching to your photosensor. You need technique to detect the faint light.

## Photodetectors
### Basic characteristics of photodetector
- **Spectral response**: Range of wavelength can be detected ***efficiently***.
- **Active area**: Part of detector is designed for producing [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectron]] when light strikes on. PMT is typically larger than others.
- **Quantum efficiency (QE) and Photon detection efficiency (PDE)**:
	- *QE* : probability for single photon coming into a *"active"* region and a photoelectron ejected.$$QE = \frac{N_{p.e.}}{N_{\gamma}}\times 100\%$$
	- *PDE* : is probability for detecable output signal generated by an incoming photon, normally smaller than *QE*, eg. $$PDE = QE \times R_{filling} \times P_{avalanche}$$
- **Dark current** : detecable output even in the completely dark *(no light source)*
- **Intrinsic range**: No. of equivalent electron in the output given an incoming photon, PMT and SiPM are in order of $10^6$
- **Dynamic range**: ratio between the maximum and minimum detectable light intensities *(with reasonably precise or good linearity)*
- **Response time** : characterize how quickly it reacts to a strike of light (maybe confused from quantum point of view) and converts them into the electric signal.

### Pulse signal terminology
- Three types of pulse : 
	- Unipolar (positive or negative)
	- Bipolar
	- Logic pulse
	![[signal shape.png]]
- Basically two dimensions of information: Amplitude and time.
	- **Amplitude**-related info : Peak or pulse height, baseline offset.
	- **Time**-related info : Rising time, falling time, peak position, pulse width.
- Also **shape**-related info : Preshoot, overshoot, ringing.
### Signal processing 
Typically presented as a series of signal processing modules, each of which have different functionality.
- signal pulse shapre is generally changed/distorted after passing each electronic modules.
- Each electronic modules induces additional noise.
#### Fourier transform : Time vs. Frequency domain.
Normally we picture the pulse as function of time but a more complete understanding of pulse change/distorted is using frequency representation.
Mathematial background : pulse form í superimposed of infinite sinusoidal components.
$$f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega)e^{i\omega t} \, d\omega \to F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t)e^{-i\omega t} \, dt  $$


## Cosmic ray
### Definition
- Particles from the outside of the Earth **(1ry cosmic ray)**
	- 90% of them are hydrogen nuclei *(proton)*
	- They interact with nitrogen and oxygen nuclei in the atmosphere and generate *2ry cosmic rays*.
	- *Muons* and *neutrinos* are also generated.
	- Typical CR muon energy is $\sim 1 - 100 GeV$
### Cosmic ray spectrum
 ![[CR spectrum.png|Cosmic ray Spectrum]]
### Why $10^{20} \sim 10^{21} eV$
High energy protons interact with **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) :**
$$p + \gamma_{CMB} \to \Delta^+ \to n + \pi^{+}$$
What is the threshold energy $E_{p}$ of such a proton ?
$$(E_{p} + E_{CMB})^2 - (p_{p} - E_{CMB})^2 = (m_{n} + m_{\pi})^2$$
Assuming $E_{p} = p_{p}$ because of high energy, we obtain
$$E_{p} = \frac{(m_{n} + m_{\pi})^2}{4E_{CMB}}$$
$$E_{CMB} = 8.62\times 10^{-5}[eVK^{-1}]\times 2.7 [K] = 2.33 \times 10^{-4}[eV]$$
$$m_{n} 940[MeV], m_{\pi} = 140[MeV] \to E_{p} = 1.25 \times 10^{21}eV$$

The number of UHE CR  coming to the Earth is suddenly suppressed at the energy of $\sim 10^{20} eV \implies$ ***Greisen-Zatspin-Kuzmin(GZK) Cutoff***

### Why at high latitude ?
To lower the cut-off rigidity $R_c$. The rigidity $R=p/z$, where $p$ is the momentum and $z$ is the charge ($R$ for a proton of $p = 1[GeV]$ is $1[GV]$ and for a helium of $p = 1[MeV]$,is $0.5[MV]$ )

### East-West effect
There is a fiffference in the number of charged cosmic rays between from east and from west.
charged cosmic ray receive a Lorentz force from the geomagnetic field. Due to the direction of the field from the south to north, positively charged particles from the west receive the force to outside and those from the east receive the force to inside. Therefore we observe the partlce from the west more than those from the east.
