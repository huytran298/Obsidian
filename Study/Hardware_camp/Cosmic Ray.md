### Energy of Cosmic ray

Energy reach $10^{20} \to 10^{21}$
High energy proton interact with cosmic microwave background(CMB):
>$$p + \gamma_{CMB} \to \Delta^{+} \to n + \pi^{+}$$$$(E_{p} + E_{CMB})^2 - (p_{p} - E_{CMB})^2 = (m_{n + M_{\pi}})^2$$

Assuming $E_{p} = p_{p}$ because of high energy, we obtain :
$$E_{p} = \frac{(m_{n} + m_{n})^2}{4E_{CMB}}$$
$E_{CMB} = 8.62 \times 10^{-5}[eVK^-1] \times 2.7[K] = 2.33 \times 10^{-4}[eV], m_{n} = 940[MeV]$ and $m_{\pi} = 140 [MeV]\to E_{p} = 1.25 \times 10^{21}(eV)$
$E_{p}$ : consitent with measurements.
#### 2ry cosmic ray generation
#### fate of $\mu$
- $2.5 GeV$ muons
- form life $15km$
- energy loss $\approx 2GeV$
## Muons
### Muon energy loss in matter 
- when muon travel in the matter, they loose their energy.
- For $E_{\mu}> 1GeV$ the energy loss can be roughly.
- More precise description and plot of muon energy loss as a function of muon energy can be found in, for example, the *Particle Data Book*.
- On the earth's surface, cosmic ray muons of energy les than $\approx 100 GeV$ is dominat. Therefore, the $-\beta E$therm of $\frac{dE}{dX} - \alpha - \beta E_{p}$ is negligible.
### Muon range and minimum intitial energy.
- The muon range $R(g/cm^2)$ is defined as the muon travel distance until is loose the energy and completely stop.
$$R = \int dX = \int_{E_{0}}^0 \frac{dE}{-\alpha - \beta E_{\mu}}$$
